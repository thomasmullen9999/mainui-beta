You have the right to cancel your agreement within 14 days, but after this point if you terminate the DBA before the end of the claim or act unreasonably (please see sections 7 and 10 of the DBA), you may be required to pay Leigh Day your share of costs as they are at that time.\n\nThe button to agree to these documents can be found at the bottom of the page.\n\n### Funding Agreement (DBA) Summary\n\nLeigh Day realise that the sign-up documents are lengthy and contain legal jargon that they are required to provide to you by law.  They have therefore set out below a summary of the main terms found within these documents.\n\n### Legal funding\n\n- You are signing a “no-win, no-fee” agreement. If Leigh Day don’t win compensation for you, and you keep to the terms of the agreement, you won’t be charged a penny.\n\n- If you do win, Leigh Day will deduct a fee equivalent to 25% (plus VAT) of any compensation obtained. The current VAT rate is 20%, which means that the total of amount of compensation payable to Leigh Day would be 30%.\n\n- In the end, no matter what, you will get 70% of your compensation (so for every £100 that you win, you will keep £70, minus any deductions for tax and National Insurance). Leigh Day think that’s fair as they are taking a risk taking the case on a “no-win, no-fee” basis and we hope that you feel this is fair too.\n\n- This means that either way the case is decided, you will not be left out of pocket. Leigh Day will never ask you to pay any fees upfront or throughout the life of the claim.\n\n### Co-operating with Leigh Day\n\n- As part of the agreement, Leigh Day require you to keep in touch with Leigh Day and to behave reasonably. If you fail to cooperate with Leigh Day, e.g. by not providing Leigh Day with your up-to-date contact details or ignoring calls, emails or letters, then Leigh Day will no longer be able to act for you and will treat you as ending the agreement. Therefore, please only sign up if you are willing to cooperate. Please refer to the funding documents for Leigh Day's rights if you fail to co-operate.\n\n- To be eligible as a client, you need to be an hourly-paid store worker or have left your employment within the last six months. This is due to the strict time limits in place for submitting a claim to the Employment Tribunal once your employment has ended.\n\n### Changing your mind\n\n- You have 14 days from signing up to change your mind about proceeding with the action and simply need to inform Leigh Day in writing that you no longer wish to proceed with the claim.\n\nPlease note, reading this summary is not a substitute for reading the funding documents themselves.\n\n{{document.URL.includes('maddisonclarke.co.uk') ? `[Read full Client Care and Costs Letter and Damaged Based Agreement](https://maddisonclarke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/COOP_DBA.pdf)` : `[Read full Client Care and Costs Letter and Damaged Based Agreement](https://www.fairpayforall.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CO-OP_DBA.pdf)` }}\n\nBy clicking the 'I accept' button below you will have joined the Co-op equal pay claim. If your claim is successful, you agree to pay Leigh Day a fee equivalent to 25% plus VAT of any compensation received from Co-op.\n\nYou have the right to cancel your agreement with Leigh Day within 14 days of entering it.\n\nLeigh Day's Privacy Policy can be found [here](https://www.leighday.co.uk/our-privacy-and-cookies-policy/)."
