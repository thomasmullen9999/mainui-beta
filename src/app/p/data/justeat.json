If Leigh Day don’t win compensation for you, and you keep to the terms of the agreement, you won’t be charged a penny.\n\n- If you do win, Leigh Day will deduct 25% plus VAT from your compensation. For example, if you receive £10,000 in compensation, they will take 25% (£2,500) plus VAT (£500), so £3,000 in total.\n\n- No matter what, if the claim is successful, you will only pay Leigh Day 25% plus VAT of whatever compensation you receive. If the claim succeeds, they'll give you a full breakdown, so you’ll understand what they have charged.\n\n### CO-OPERATING WITH LEIGH DAY\n\n- It’s really important that you cooperate with Leigh Day. If you fail to cooperate with them, then they will no longer be able to act for you. They will do all that they can to make it as easy as possible for you to take part in the claim.\n\n- To be eligible to join the claim, you need to have worked at least one job directly for Just Eat using the Just Eat courier app (not, for example, using the Stuart app) in the last 10 weeks from today’s date. However, please feel free to register your interest if you have not worked in the last 10 weeks but think that you may work for Just Eat again in the future, as you may be able to join the claim at that stage.\n\n- Your claim will be brought in the Employment Tribunal, where the general rule is that each party covers their own costs, no matter who wins or loses. The Employment Tribunal does have the power to order that a party (for example, someone bringing a claim) pays costs if they have behaved badly, such as lying to the Employment Tribunal or not cooperating with the Employment Tribunal process. We do not think that there is a risk that an Employment Tribunal would order you to pay costs if you brought a claim, and we would let you know immediately if this changed.\n\n### CHANGING YOUR MIND\n\n- You have 14 days from sign up to change your mind about proceeding with the action and simply need to inform Leigh Day in writing that you no longer wish to proceed with the claim. Please note, reading this summary is not a substitute for reading the funding documents themselves.\n\n- I confirm that I wish to instruct Leigh Day to seek to recover compensation on my behalf in respect of my work for Just Eat and that I have read and understood the terms of the DBA and other attachments.\n\n"
